# APCSA FINAL PROJECT

A Java demonstration using Graphics of Wilson's Algorithm implemented for Maze Generation.

Maze implemented to make a game with a Player that uses Keyevents and Keylisteners to traverse the maze to get to the green cell which is generated randomly but programmed to be a specific distance from the start cell. To see the building of the Maze visually go to Maze.java and change the FPMS instance variable to an integer greater than 0.
